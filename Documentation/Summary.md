*Jen-Scripts uses grids to store values that correspond to 2-dimensional terrain. The functions in this asset are used to change and shape the values in the grid. The data inside the grid can be anything youâ€™d like including objects, numbers, text, structs, etcetera. However, to transform the grid data into terrain, you will need to instantiate the grid, treating the data inside as either objects or tilemap data.*

*Jen-Scripts does not generate terrain for you. You will need to use the functions provided to 'describe' the terrain you want. This section of the documentation deals with the fundamentals of using Jen-Scripts, including creating a new grid for use with terrain generation, instantiating your terrain, and other functions which are helpful to know throughout the entire process of programming your terrain generation. Later sections cover how to take the basics and actually produce procedurally generated content.*

*Talk about replace and new_value parameters, because they are everywhere.*

*Add a page for function parameter, because they are also quite frequent.*

*Talk about how Jen-Scripts handles string, such as when instantiating.*
