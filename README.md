The library includes support for most common terrain generation techniques, including heightmaps, cellular automata, wandering paths, maze generation, flood-fill, and geometric shapes. Furthermore, terrain data can be stored, copied, and combined, allowing for easy integration of hand-crafted content into the procedurally generated level.
